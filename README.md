### Project Description/Outline
We are aiming to answer questions pertaining to what some may call a "dying industry." What factors go into making the theatrical release of a movie successful? Is a movie successful based on how much money was put into its production? Are certain genres more economical? Do movies with MPAA ratings that cater to a wider audience make more money in theaters? These are just some of the questions we're hoping to answer.

### Our Hypotheses
- High production cost results in higher worldwide sales
- There is a significant difference between movie genres when it comes to profitability 
- There's a strong correlation between opening weekend sales and worldwide sales
- Summer movies have higher opening weekend sales
- MPAA Rating significantly impacts worldwide sales 

### Our Null Hypotheses
- Higher production costs do not result in higher or lower worldwide sales
- There is no significant difference in profitability between movie genres
- There is no correlation between opening weekend sales and worldwide sales
- Summer movies do not have higher opening weekend sales compared to non-summer movies
- There is no difference in worldwide sales when it comes to a movieâ€™s MPAA Rating
